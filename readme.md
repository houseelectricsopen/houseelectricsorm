This is an implementation of an object relational mapping for sqlite on android.

This is an implementation of an object relational mapping for sqlite on android.
It contains a minimum set of sufficient features to map a java object model to a relational database in an android app but nervertheless places a low burden on the developer.

Here are some of the features:
1. No database ids in domain objects â€“ sqlite rowid is mapped internally to java domain object instances.
2. List Support
3. Polymorphic References
4. Customizeable type to db field mapping
5. Raw query s
6. Lazy Loading
