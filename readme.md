This is an implementation of an object relational mapping for sqlite on android.
It contains a minimal set of features to map a java object model to a relational database in an android app but nevertheless places a low burden on the developer.

Here are some of the features:
+ No database ids in domain objects â€“ sqlite rowid is mapped internally to java domain object instances.
+ List Support
+ Polymorphic References
+ Customizeable type to db field mapping
+ Raw query s
+ Lazy Loading
